# Here is the dictionary for this file:
# id: station id assigned by MAPC; corresponds to strt_statn and end_statn in trips table
# terminal: Hubway-assigned station identifier
# station: station name
# municipal: Municipality
# lat: station latitude
# lng: station longitude
# status: Existing station locations and ones that have been removed or relocated
# 
# 3. Look at the summary of this data frame with Hubway station information. 
# Some of these bike stations don't exist anymore; 
# create a data frame with only those that still exist. How many are left?
